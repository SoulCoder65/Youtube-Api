# Youtube-Api
I have created a web application using youtube/google api. We can fetch data of particular channel using channel id like videos count ,views count, subscribers etc and i also fetch playlist data and data of every video of each playlist and display these data in form of card so its look like youtube clone . i have also attached some snap of projects in images folder.
